# OpenConnectCompanion

**OpenConnectCompanion** is a fast, open-source, self-hostable tool for synchronizing, analyzing, and visualizing data from Garmin smartwatches and cycling computers — all written in Python.

It aims to provide a feature set comparable to **Garmin Connect®**, while staying lightweight, fully open-source, and free from unnecessary bloat. Even if Garmin’s services were ever discontinued, OpenConnectCompanion is designed to remain fully functional for its users, as it does not depend on any Garmin services. 

## Contributing
Feel free to make a pull request about anything you would like added. Please keep in mind however, that currently only bugfixes and features which mimic features of **Garmin Connect®** 1:1. In case of not being able to code, feel free to open an issue! Translations are currently not possible due to the architecture.
