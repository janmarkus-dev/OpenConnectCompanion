# OpenConnectCompanion

**OpenConnectCompanion** is a fast, open-source, self-hostable tool for synchronizing, analyzing, and visualizing data from Garmin smartwatches and cycling computers — all written in Python.

It aims to provide a feature set identical to **Garmin Connect™**, while staying lightweight, fully open-source, and free from unnecessary bloat. Even if Garmin’s services were ever discontinued, OpenConnectCompanion is designed to remain fully functional for its users, as it does not depend on any Garmin services. 

## Contributing
Feel free to submit a pull request for anything you’d like to see added.  
Please note, however, that at the moment we only accept bug fixes and features that replicate Garmin Connect™ functionality exactly.  

If you’re unable to contribute code, you’re welcome to open an issue instead!  
Currently, translations are not possible due to the existing architecture.
