# OpenConnectCompanion

**OpenConnectCompanion** is a fast, open-source, self-hostable tool for synchronizing, analyzing, and visualizing data from Garmin smartwatches and cycling computers — all written in Python.

It aims to provide a feature set comparable to **Garmin Connect**, while staying lightweight, fully open-source, and free from unnecessary bloat. Even if Garmin’s services were ever discontinued, OpenConnectCompanion is designed to remain fully functional for its users, as it does not depend on any Garmin services. 

## Thanks to these projects for their code:
- Python
- Flask
- TailwindCSS
- fitparse

## Roadmap:
- 1.9. first demo with 1 graph

> OpenConnectCompanion is an independent open-source project and is not affiliated with or endorsed by Garmin Ltd. or its subsidiaries.
