# Contributing
Feel free to submit a pull request for anything you’d like to see added.  
Please note, however, that at the moment we only accept bug fixes and features that replicate Garmin Connect™ functionality exactly.  

If you’re unable to contribute code, you’re welcome to open an issue instead! Currently, translations are not possible due to the existing architecture.
